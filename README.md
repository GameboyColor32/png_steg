# png_steg

This project is a personal exploration of the PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file format. The primary objectives are to gain a better understanding of the PNG format, improve proficiency in the Rust programming language, and learn how to hide messages within PNG files.

## Project Overview

### Motivation

My motivation behind this project is threefold:

1. **Understanding PNG Format**: PNG is a widely-used image file format, I wanted to understand what was happening under the hood.

2. **Rust Proficiency**: Rust is my main end year project for my Epitech masters, I wanted to become better at it.

3. **Steganography**: Hiding messages within images (steganography) is a fascinating area of study. This project will explore how to embed and extract hidden information in PNG files.

### Key Objectives

- **PNG Parsing**: Develop the ability to parse PNG files, including the header, chunks, and image data.

- **Image Manipulation**: Implement functionality for modifying PNG images, including encoding and decoding data.

- **Steganography**: Explore techniques for hiding and extracting messages within PNG files.
